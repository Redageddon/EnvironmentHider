# Environment Hider
A plugin that allows you to disable any object in any environment.

## Notes:
Default is also known as "The First", they are used interchangeably

TheFirst/Default, and Nice are the two most used environments by mappers

### UI:
Game environment works like this:
the first row is a dropdown of every environment, the checkbox to the right is if that environment should use the hidden value. This allows you to keep your settings for a specific environment, while not having the settings effect that environment. 

The 3 tabs (Static, Dynamic, Light) are how beat saber splits up its environment objects.
Static objects are usually only meshes that don't actually have anything special about them.
Dynamic is objects that can change or update (EX: the spectograms). 
The Light objects are ones that usually contain lights or particales in them
